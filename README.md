# Product Category Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model that automatically predicts the category of a product based on its title.  
The goal is to reduce manual classification effort and improve efficiency in an online retail environment.

## Business Context
Online stores add thousands of new products every day. Manual category assignment is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can automate this process and improve operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset (`products.csv`) contains over 30,000 products with the following relevant fields:
- Product Title
- Category Label
- Merchant information and metadata
